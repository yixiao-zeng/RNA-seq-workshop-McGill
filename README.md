# Precision Health Bootcamp: 2-Part RNA-seq Workshop (2022)

Part 1: RNA-seq - From Raw Data to Processed Data

In the first part of this workshop, participants will be introduced to RNA-seq data and the steps required to clean it. Using a pre-formatted raw expression count matrix, we will cover data visualization, filtering, and normalization techniques. By the end of Part 1, participants will have a fully processed dataset, ready for differential gene expression and gene-pathway enrichment analysis.


Part 2: RNA-seq - Differential Expression and Beyond

The second part of the workshop builds on the processed data from Part 1. Participants will learn how to conduct principal component analysis (PCA) and differential expression analysis. Additionally, we will explore tools for gene enrichment and pathway analysis.
