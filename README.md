# Precision Health Bootcamp 2-part RNA-seq Workshop 2022

Part 1 - RNA-seq: From Raw to Processed Data

Part 1 of the workshop will introduce what RNA-seq data looks like and how to clean the data. Starting with a raw expression count matrix (pre-formatted for participantsâ€™ convenience), we will go through steps to visualize, filter, and normalize the data. At the end of Part 1, our processed data will be ready to perform differentially expressed gene and gene-pathway enrichment analysis on.


Part 2 - RNA-seq: Differential Expression and Beyond

Part 2 of the workshop will start with processed counts data and run through how to conduct principle component analysis, differential expression, as well as introduce tools for gene enrichment and pathway analysis.
